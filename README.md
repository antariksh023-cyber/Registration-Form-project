# Registration Form

A complete multi-field registration form with text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, textarea, and submit/reset buttons.

Built today as my **2nd project** while learning CSS (after ~20 min of Bro Code 1-hour CSS course). Rebuilt from memory and styled myself.

- Add basic form validation hints (CSS + JS later)
- Improve typography & colors (finish CSS course first)
